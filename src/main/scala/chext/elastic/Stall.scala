/** `Stall` conditionally stalls tokens.
  *
  * It connects a source and sink interface, and forwards tokens from source to sink only when a
  * user-defined condition is **true**. If the condition is **false**, the token is stalled.
  *
  * Once the stall condition is false (i.e., there is a transfer downstream), it should not turn
  * true until the transfer is complete. This is due to the irrevocable nature of the elastic
  * components. If this condition cannot be satisfied, place a sink buffer.
  *
  * @param source
  *   The upstream interface providing tokens that might be stalled.
  * @param sink
  *   The downstream interface accepting tokens.
  * @tparam Tin
  *   Type of the input token.
  * @tparam Tout
  *   Type of the output token.
